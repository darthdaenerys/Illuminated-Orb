# Illuminating Orb

A colourful Orb created using vpython in visual studio code. It makes the transition from one colour to other using a smooth animation while maintaining a constant brightness. Three cylindrical meters are on the left which shows how much intensity a specific colour channel has in the orb. Below is also the label of RGB values and also the total brightness across all channels.
